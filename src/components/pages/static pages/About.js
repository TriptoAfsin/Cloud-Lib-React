No matter where they are, what they read they need books as a companion, let it be in the form notes or lectures. But the basic and a large portion of the information and  gets deprived when it is shortened. Again, the literature enthusiasts might be or want to be reminisced with any books they read.

            The comic lover would want to read the whole series of the latest comic. But unavailability of 
            these books might cut their inner want and hunger towards those books.In order to make the books
